# MINI-PROJECT-HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION




Heart disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Predicting cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques is crucial in clinical data science, given the vast amount of healthcare data available.

# Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes. Initially, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was employed, achieving an accuracy of 84%. Subsequently, a Random Forest classifier was implemented, achieving an accuracy of 81%.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various medical attributes that are hypothesized to be related to heart disease. Attributes include age, sex, cholesterol levels, and others. 

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

# Conclusion
Both KNN and Random Forest classifiers were applied to predict heart disease from the dataset. While KNN achieved a slightly higher accuracy of 84%, the Random Forest classifier also performed well with an accuracy of 81%. Further optimization and feature engineering could potentially improve results.
